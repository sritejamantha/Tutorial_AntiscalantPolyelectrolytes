# Tutorial_AntiscalantPolyelectrolytes

![Actions](https://github.com/sritejamantha/Tutorial_AntiscalantPolyelectrolytes/actions/workflows/actions.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

The colab notebook is part of the series of hands on tutorial workshop conducted by me (Sriteja Mantha) at Dow-Terneuzen, Netherlands

The notebook integrates python and shell scripts Alec Glisman and I developed as part of our currently ongoing Caltech-Dow collaborative research efforts on molecular modeling of Antiscalant Polyelectrolytes.

Please refer to the following manuscripts for more information on the models and methodology, and cite them appropriately:
